# Iris Flower Classification
Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their measurements. We have the measurements of the iris flowers according to their species, and here I've trained a machine learning model that can classify them based on their measurement of Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width.

### Note: 
This project is a part of my internship with Oasis Infobyte.
